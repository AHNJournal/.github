## Applied Human Neurosecurity Journal Version 1.0 

Welcome to the research and development wiki of [Applied Human Neurosecurity Journal](https://open-neurosecurity.org).

Our global mission is to promote and support research, education and advocacy of applied human neurosecurity.  

## History and credits

Applied human neurosecurity is a next-generation **science domain** inspired by computer security principles and the [free software movement](https://www.gnu.org), aiming to become a **universal** and **free** replacement over proprietary/closed-source psychiatry. In contrast, binary [neurosecurity](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosecurity) is a set of practices and methods for securing brain-machine computer interfaces against vulnerabilities in proprietary devices and softwares.
